          <h2>That's why Cassie exists.</h2>
          <p>
            Cassie is a symbolic equation solver written in pure 
            Haskell. It can solve nonlinear systems of equations 
            over both real numbers and matrices. Compute a formula 
            in the simplest possible terms from a handful of equations
            or just use it to crunch numbers. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Keep doing what you're doing.</h2>
          <p>
            Cassie is written for GHC's experimental WebAssembly 
            backend. Not everyone wants to use Haskell, but that 
            doesn't mean that you can't tap into Cassie's algorithms.
            Tie into Cassie in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, or 
            anywhere else you can call into WebAssembly, and keep 
            writing your project. For those that only need the solver
            functionality, just learn the (incredibly simple) Cassie 
            language. Already know Haskell? Add the <i>cassie</i> 
            package to your Cabal workspace and leverage the ability 
            to solve equations over everything from matrices down to 
            booleans.
          </p>

          <h2>Keep it simple, stupid.</h2>
          <p>
            The Cassie Language only requires learning a few concepts
            common to a plethora of existing programming languages.
            No need to learn conditionals, loops, or object-oriented 
            language features, just bring your engineering math knowledge 
            and we'll handle the rest.
